**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br />
In my opinion, the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was learning about prior audits conducted on LLMs. I especially enjoyed reading and discussing the paper by Stuart and his capstone group from last year, titled “Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern.” This paper tested for biases in salary negotiation recommendations for a role at Google, analyzing how factors like gender, name, major, university, and perspective of employee versus employer influenced the LLMs’ advice. As someone currently job seeking, this topic resonated with me and has made me reconsider relying solely on LLMs for tasks like these.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br />
As my section is titled “Community-Centered Discrimination Audits of LLMs,” my mentor, Stuart, is encouraging us to focus on projects that actively involve the community, such as by interviewing community members to understand their concerns surrounding LLMs. With this in mind, a potential investigation I would like to pursue is _______.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br />
A potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is the group of people I consult. In Quarter 1, I relied on close friends and family to understand their concerns about LLMs and help brainstorm audit ideas, which limited the range of perspectives I considered. For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to change this approach by engaging with community members outside my immediate social circles, as suggested by my mentor. I would like to get their feedback on different aspects of my project, such as the prompts and the model being audited, to ensure the audit addresses concerns that are relevant and helpful to the broader community.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** <br />
One technique I would be interested in exploring is the pipeline for feeding prompts into LLMs. For my current project, I relied heavily on code provided by my mentor, but I would like to gain a deeper understanding of how the prompt-processing pipeline works, if my schedule allows. Additionally, another technique I think would be interesting to implement is making our final website interactive, rather than static. Since my domain focuses on auditing LLMs using prompts, I think allowing users to input their own names or select different features to feed into the LLM could create a more engaging experience. This would also enable users to compare their results with our findings in real time.
